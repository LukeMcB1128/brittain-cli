// The system prompts and the tool payload sent with them.
//
// Pruned (docs/PLAN.md §4.4): every line about browser tools, run_subagent, online
// research, attachments, calculate, research logs, and the no-screen (remote)
// addendum. The tool-index/stubbing machinery is not ported (§4.1): v1 sends
// every schema in full, and the budget test holds the total down instead.
// chatSystemPrompt is gone with chat mode (brittain.app covers chat).
//
// Memory, pinned content, BRITTAIN.md, and user-wide instructions are appended
// as data under an explicit framing, never as rules.
